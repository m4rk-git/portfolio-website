# portfolio-website

This is my personal portfolio website. 
You can watch die Preview of my Portfolio [here](https://m4rk-git.github.io/portfolio-website/)

##Description
The Website is built with React.js and Tailwind CSS mostly. 3D models are made by three.js. 

##Motivation
I wanted to start learning, how to create Web Applications. After some research, I decided to start with React.js. I wanted to concentrate on the Frontend at first to not get overwhelmed immediately, and a portfolio website was perfect for this. 

##Credits
The Code is based on the public GitHub project [3D Developer Portfolio](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_3D_developer_portfolio).
